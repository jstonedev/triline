# Triline

## How to use

### 1. Clone repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jstonedev/triline
```

### 2. Run the app

Now that the server is running, you can start the React app as well. The commands need to be run in a new terminal tab/window inside the root directory `hackernews-clone-react` (because the current tab is blocked by the process running the server):

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can now open your browser and use the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
